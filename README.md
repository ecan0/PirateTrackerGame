# PirateTrackerGame

A simple project where an agent (pirate) learns to navigate a maze to reach a treasure using a deep Q-learning approach using Tensorflow and Keras.

## Project Overview
- Uses a maze matrix to represent the environment.
- Employs a neural network to approximate Q-values.
- Relies on experience replay to train the agent.
- Demonstrates the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.

## Setup
1. Install required packages (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib, Keras).
2. Open the notebook in VS Code or any Jupyter-based environment.
3. Run all cells to train the model and evaluate performance.

## Files
- CANDELA_ERIC_PROJECTTWO.IPYNB: Main notebook containing code and training flow.
- TreasureMaze.py: Environment logic for maze navigation.
- GameExperience.py: Records agent experiences for replay.

## Usage
1. Adjust hyperparameters in the notebook if needed (e.g., epochs, batch size).
2. Run the training cells to construct and train the model.
3. Use completion checks and the play_game function to validate performance.
